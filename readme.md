# Password Generator

Modified the given code to randomly generate a password for the user.

# Description

I was asked to randomly generate a password that meets the correct criteria to provide better security for sensitive information.

# Features

I was given a code. Then was asked to provide prompts to allow the user to apply the correct requirements for their password when entering the website.
I recieved some major help from a TA regarding my prompts and all my commented description on what my code still needs. Majority of that was working through with her to make sure I understood the code and how to apply it.
See the notes.js for the examples and things we discussed.
